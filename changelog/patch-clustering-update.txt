Hello @everyone,

Pokemon Auto Chess release 1.7: Meta is here!

A lot of changes, both on the gameplay, the interface and the balance. The Normal/Sound, Ground/Mineral, Bug/Poison, Grass/Flora compositions have dominated the metagame since the release of the item update.
It is also the occasion to present the results of the very first intern (@ogus) in Keldaan Interactive. His internship topic was about clustering game statistics. As you will see, his results  exceed my expectations.

**Meta Report**

The addition of a meta report part in pokemon auto chess is the big news of this update. Like other games, the meta report gives a set of information about the current state of the meta. It's as useful for new players who want some ideas about team composition as it is for more experienced players who want to try to climb up in elo.
Accessible from the lobby, you will find a new tab "meta report" with 3 different tabs: Best team Compositions, Item report and discover ...

**Best Team Compositions**

Here you will find all the informations you need about the current possible team composition, their popularity, their winrate and their average place.

**Item Report**

All about item statistics, average place, popularity and the top 3 pokemons that run this item.

**Discover**

This is the tab I'm most proud of, a 2 dimensional view of the current state of the metagame. Each point is a game. If you hover your mouse over a point you can find the team and rank the player used

**Balance Changes**

Introducing a few balance change. I hope to see more playable compositions in the future.
