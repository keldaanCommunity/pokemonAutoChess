# New Pokemons:

# Changes to Pokemon & Abilities

# Changes to Synergies

- Weather rocks are no longer collected during PVE rounds

# Changes to Items

# Gameplay

- Ranked matches created by Ultra ball rank and above are now open with a min elo requirement of Super ball rank instead of Pokeball rank. The previous overlap was too large and ended up counter-productive.

# UI

# Bugfix

# Misc

- The amount of elo gained or loss on the first games of a fresh new account is increased, and progressively decrease down to the standard K=32 factor after 20 games played. [More details here](https://discord.com/channels/737230355039387749/1404514365406969868)
