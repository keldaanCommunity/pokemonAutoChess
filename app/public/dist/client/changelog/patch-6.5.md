# New Pokemons:

# Changes to Pokemon & Abilities

# Changes to Synergies

- Weather rocks are no longer collected during PVE rounds

# Changes to Items

- Nerf Green Orb: removed flat part of the healing, removed base 15 PP

# Gameplay

- Ranked matches created by Ultra ball rank and above are now open with a min elo requirement of Super ball rank instead of Pokeball rank. The previous overlap was too large and ended up counter-productive.

# Bugfix
