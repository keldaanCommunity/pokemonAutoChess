# New Pokemons:

- Drilbur
- Excadrill

# Changes to Pokemon & Abilities

- Meltan: PP 80 → 50

# Changes to Synergies

- Ground rework: Ground Pokémon dig holes on board in between stages, and gain stats based on the depth of the hole they start in. They sometimes find buried items at max depth (5 stages).
- Weather rocks are no longer collected during PVE rounds

# Changes to Items

- Big Nugget is replaced by Explorer Kit. Explorer Kit increases the chances of finding gold buried in the ground.
- New Items: Rusty Coin, Nugget, Big Nugget
- New items: Synergy gems ; synergy gems increase the level of a synergy but are unholdable

# Gameplay

- Ranked matches created by Ultra ball rank and above are now open with a min elo requirement of Super ball rank instead of Pokeball rank. The previous overlap was too large and ended up counter-productive.

# UI

# Bugfix

# Misc

- The amount of elo gained or loss on the first games of a fresh new account is increased, and progressively decrease down to the standard K=32 factor after 20 games played. [More details here](https://discord.com/channels/737230355039387749/1404514365406969868)
