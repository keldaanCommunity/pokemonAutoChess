Hello @everyone,

I am very happy to release Pokemon Auto Chess 1.9: The PMD Collab update. This update features a complete rework of every pokemon as well as a new collection/booster system.

**Pokemon Sprites**

Every pokemon sprites of Pokemon Auto Chess has been reworked. Pokemon Auto Chess sprites are now based on the collaborative project PMD Collab (http://sprites.pmdcollab.org/).

**What is PMD Collab ?**

PMD Collab is a collaborative repository (http://sprites.pmdcollab.org/). This is a comprehensive resource of official sprites from the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon NDS games, and custom sprites made in the same style.

**Sprite Rework**

Every pokemon sprites is now taken from PMD Collab. It means:

- New animation: Idle
- Improvement of the existing ones: Movement/Attack/Sleep animations are now way more detailled and smooth
- Shadow is now following the pokemon
- Shadow size is adapted to every pokemon
- Pokemon now have a large variety of emotions (more detail down there).
- Pokemons can be shiny ! See new Collection system for more detail.

All of those benefits comes with one drawback, game assets are now 6x bigger than before (around 50 Mo). 

**Missing sprites**

Some of the pokemons that are in pokemon auto chess are not yet in in PMD Collab. In game, it'll result as a missingno sprite. To fix this, please consider donating to the pokemon auto chess tipee (https://en.tipeee.com/pokemon-auto-chess). Every donation will be used to pay spriters to make the missing sprites.

**New system: Pokemon Collection & Boosters**

Now, each time you level up (a level is now 1000 xp (was 10 000 before for high level)), you 'll get one booster. You can open those "boosters" in the booster tab.
When opening boosters, you get pokemon shards. Those shards are specific to every pokemon. In the collection tab, you can buy pokemon emotions with those shards.
You can see pokemon emotions as a detailled customization. When selecting an emotion pokemon portrait, the pokemon will appear everywhere with the same emotion portrait that you have selected.
Eveyone will see the emotion that you picked for this pokemon. Moreover, if you have selected a shiny emotion, the pokemon will appear shiny to everyone else.

**New avatar system**

Every pokemon emotion that you have bought will be available in the profile avatar icon section.

**Old account transformation**

Your account avatar will be reset to rattata. To reward your actual experience in pokemon auto chess, you 'll get a amount of boosters equivalent to 6x your current level.
