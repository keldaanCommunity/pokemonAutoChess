## Prepare your stage entrance

 PvP fights now have a portal transition animation when entering the fight, where you may go to your opponent's region for the duration of a fight. Wild Pokemons in PvE rounds will also make a stage entrance during the picking phase. 

## New town encounters

Sableye and Celebi can now be found in town encounters. The town carousel has been adjusted to be better centered and move around more easily.
