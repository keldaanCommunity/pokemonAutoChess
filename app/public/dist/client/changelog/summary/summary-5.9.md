## Mega Exodus

Most of the Megas in Ultra category have been temporarely removed to make room for new families. They will be back in a future update.

## TMs & HMs

Human synergy is reworked and now gives you TMs and HMs that can be used to teach new moves to your Human Pokemon.

## Changes to ranks and penalties

The rank system has been reworked and now has 12 different levels. Elo and XP are now distributed immediately on player elimination, and there are more penalties to leaving a game before it ends.
