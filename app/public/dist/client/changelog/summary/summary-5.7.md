## Finally you can blame luck

Added a Luck statistic that influence all random draws: critical hit, dodge chance, chance to apply status on attack, wild chance, egg chance etc. Lucky Egg has been reworked to give Luck.

##  The monsters are out

Monsters now get max HP based on the HP of their victims. Added Monster 9 Merciless: Monsters can target allies with less than 15% of their max HP.

## Weather rocks rework

Rock synergy now requires you to fight in a certain weather to collect the weather rocks. These rocks do not give synergies anymore but help take the best out of the weather. Added 5 new weather rocks and a new weather Smog for poison type.
