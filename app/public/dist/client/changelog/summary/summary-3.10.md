# Patch 3.10: New Wave

## A big wave of synergy reworks for the summer

Dragon, Water, Psychic, Rock, Monster and Artifical synergies have been reworked with new exclusive mechanics !

## Familiar faces

Fish for Magikarp, or get Unowns in the shop. They may look weak at first, but they have some surprises in store. We also welcome Pinsir, Natu and Xatu !

## Balance everything

Many items, pokemons and rarity percentages have been tweaked to improve the balance of the game. We want the game to be in a good state for the summer, while we work on the next major 4.0 version.
