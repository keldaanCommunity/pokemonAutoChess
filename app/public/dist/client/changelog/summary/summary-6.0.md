## Statistics rework

Attack speed, move speed and ability cooldown have all been merged into a single stat: Speed. Every Pokemon now has a different base speed, taken from the main series games. Use that information wisely for your item builds !

Also, defense and special defense numbers have all been doubled, with the damage reduction formula adjusted so that it doesn't have any impact but allow finer tweaks to the def/spedef numbers of each Pokemon and effect in the game.
