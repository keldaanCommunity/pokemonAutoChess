# Major changes

- Introducing Treasure Town, the new starting map for each game. This is where players join for carousel rounds, or to take a portal leading them to a new region. Game now starts at stage zero at Treasure Town, and players can influence their starting region by choosing a portal.
- During carousel rounds, you may encounter famous residents of Treasure Town. Some of them are traders that will sell you precious items for gold, while others may influence the game in other ways.
- Attack speed, move speed and ability cooldowns have all been merged into one statistic: Speed. 1 Speed = 1% attack speed in previous patch. Pokemons have a different base speed depending on the species, taken from their Speed stat in the original games of the license. Many attack and max PP stats have been adjusted to compensate for the difference of base speed. Maximum speed is 300 = 2.5 attacks per second, and minimum is 0 = 0.4 attacks per second. Just like attack speed in previous patch, the speed stat is linear, which means going from 0 to 10 speed has the same value as going from 50 to 60 speed.
- Defense and special defense stats have all been doubled, and damage reduction formula changed to `1/(1+def/20)` instead of `1/(1+def/10)`. All the effects impacting these stats have been adjusted as well, so this has no impact on balance in practice. This was done so that attack and defense values ​​are more easily comparable, and to allow more precise number tweaking in the future for effects impacting these stats.
