# Changes to Pokemon & Abilities

## Reworks

- Many abilities targeting in a line have been reworked to apply on more angles than the 8 basic orientations (vertical, horizontal and diagonals). In short, these abilities will have a better targeting now. Abilities concerned: Dynamax Cannon, Bonemerang, Shadow Bone, Aurora Beam, Hydropump, Solar Beam (nerfed), Psybeam, Hurricane, Fleur Cannon (nerfed), Sandsear Storm (nerfed), Wildbolt Storm (nerfed), Bleakwing Storm (nerfed), Springtide Storm (nerfed), Spirit Shackle (nerfed), Icy Wind (nerfed), Mist Ball, Luster Purge, Link Cable (nerfed), Aura Sphere, Moongeist Beam, Blood Moon, Freezing Glare, Electro Shot, Twin Beam
- Rework Terrain pulse (Arboliva): change effects by unit tier: GRASS_FIELD: 5/5/5 → 5/7/10 % max HP healed ; ELECTRIC_FIELD: 10/10/10 → 10/12/15 SPEED buff; PSYCHIC_FIELD: 10/10/10 → 10/12/15 PP gain ; FAIRY_FIELD: 5/5/5 → 5/7/10 % of max HP as SHIELD

- Rework Wish (Togepi): Grant 30/60/120 SHIELD and 1 second PROTECT to the lowest % HP ally. Togepi line PP: 70 → 100

> Togepi with AP itemization in ghost vertical is a comp that exists since patch 5.7, but for some reason became super popular only recently. Although the consistency of this composition is shaky (as we saw in last tournament), many players loudly voiced their dislike for this strategy that they judge unfun to play against. So we're reworking Togepi to no longer be able to buff allies dodge to the maximum. It should still remain a valuable support Pokémon with the targeted protect.

- Primal Groudon change weather to DROUGHT or SANDSTORM based on your dominant synergy between FIRE and GROUND
- Primal Kyogre change weather to RAIN or STORM based on your dominant synergy between WATER and ELECTRIC
- Ho-Oh no longer changes weather to DROUGHT.
- Lugia no longer changes weather to WINDY.
- XD001 no longer changes weather to NIGHT.
- Xerneas no longer changes weather to MISTY.
- Castform now changes to Sunny form under DROUGHT or ZENITH
- New passive for Shaymin Sky form: change weather to ZENITH

> Players are asking for more weather enforcers passive for legendary Pokémon, but having too much ruins the weather system and prevents strategizing around weather. So we're currently looking to limit the amount of weather enforcers. Shaymin Sky still gets the opportunity to make the sun shine.

- New ability for Snom line: Powder Snow: A snow mist is blown towards the target, dealing 15/30/60 SPECIAL to all enemies in a line with 15/30/50% chance to FREEZE them for 2 seconds. ; RANGE: 2 → 3, DEF: 4/6 → 2/4
- Change Shieldon line: now also has ROCK synergy. DEF 10/16 → 6/12, SPE_DEF 6/8 → 4/8

- Rework Psychic Surge (Tapu Lele): Now grants 40 SHIELD to all PSYCHIC allies except user ; PP 80 → 100

> Psychic really didnt need even more AP. Funny numbers aside, Tapu Lele's Psychic Surge was barely useful, so we're instead giving what Psychic lacks: defense and time.

- Change Comfey: holder no longer gains  and AP from Comfey, only max HP, ATK, DEF and SPE_DEF. Comfey SPEED 57 → 64
- Tauros now is WILD NORMAL FIELD. Adjusted stats.
- Kangashkan is now NORMAL MONSTER FIGHTING ; New ability: Dizzy Punch: Deal 20/40/80 SPECIAL to the target and inflict them with CONFUSION for 3 seconds. The damage is doubled if the target has a SHIELD.
- Change Fur Coat (Furfrou, Wooloo): now gains 2 DEF and loses 5 SPEED until it reaches max stacks (5 for Furfrou, 10 for Wooloo). If groomed at max stacks, player gains a SILK_SCARF.

> Sewing a scarf with its wool is the only thing that can make Wooloo vaguely interesting, otherwise it's just a Mareep with flat battery. You should have more reasons to groom your Furfrou as well.

- New ability for Scizor: Bullet Punch
- Mothim is now sold for 3 GOLD instead of 6
- Paldean Wooper is now exclusive to POISON regions
- Heavy Slam (Aron line) no longer gives Shield to user.
- New ability for Piplup line: Wave Splash: User shrouds itself in water, gaining [20,SP]% of its max HP as SHIELD, then slams into the target with its whole body to inflict [20,SP]% of its max HP as SPECIAL

> You might want to put a crown on the head of kings and emperors

## Buffs

> Nothing too crazy here, just giving some love to Psychic. Hatenna and Metang should hold the line longer now to give you time to unleash your psychic powers.

- Buff Manectric: Attack 12 → 14
- Buff Bidoof line HP: 65/140 → 70/150
- Icicle missile (Vanillite) travels faster: 1.5 second → 1 second

## Nerfs

- Nerf Fleur Cannon damage: 120 → 100

- Nerf Solar Beam damage buff on ZENITH: +100% → +30%
- Nerf Growth buff on ZENITH: +100% → +30%
- Nerf Tadbulb line. Passive damage is reduced from 30 to 10, no longer scales with AP and is considered retaliation damage. First supercharge gives 30 → 20 SPEED and 50 → 30 SHIELD. Added a 3 seconds cooldown between passive procs.

> Sorry, we messed up with Bellibolt. No cooldown on passive was a huge mistake, this unit was dealing way too much damage. Time to calm down the tummy.

- Nerf Honedge line: HP 85/130/230 → 75/120/210 ; DEF 6/10/14 → 4/8/14 ; King's shield SHIELD: 10/20/30 → 10/20/40
- Nerf Wiglett line: PP 80 → 100
- Nerf Whirlpool (Seadra): 125 → 100% ATK damage per hit

- Nerf Bellsprout line: HP 70/150/230 → 60/130/200
- Nerf Meganium HP: 250 → 220
- Nerf Bellossom HP: 300 → 250
- Nerf Carnivine: SPEED 40 → 29 ; Nerf Power Whip: 50% → 30% of HP as bonus SPECIAL
- Nerf Xerneas: HP 300 → 200

> Nerfing Flora pots HP and their best unique and legendary carries

- Nerf Mind Blown (Blacephalon): damage and shield per firework: 30 → 20
- Change Iron Thorns: SPEED buff: 25 → 20, HP gained: 40 → 30 ; Remove cooldown on subsequent casts after supercharge

> "Cool design but numbers off the chart" is a good summary of 6.7. We hope you enjoyed the new year fireworks and thunderbolts, but it's time to tone it down a bit.

## Regional changes

- Scizor, Kleavor, Galarian Moltres, Galarian Zapdos, Galarian Articuno and Walking Wake are now found in more regions.

> Regional uniques/legendaries should hopefully be more common now, so that you don't have to screenshot every time you see one to prove it exists.

- Larvesta line is now regional in BUG and FIRE regions

# Changes to Synergies

- NORMAL rework: 
    - Normal (3): gain 15 SHIELD. Get a SILK_SCARF
    - Normal (5): gain 20 SHIELD. Get a second SILK_SCARF
    - Normal (7): gain 25 SHIELD. Get a third SILK_SCARF
    - Normal (9) gain 30 SHIELD. Get a fourth SILK_SCARF. All scarves holders gain 30% increased base ATK and 30 AP.

> Making NORMAL complex, diversified and interesting is for sure a challenge. Let's try anyway and bring the emblematic scarves of the Mystery Dungeon games into PAC.

- New synergy effect GRASS 9 Overflow: Once below 30% max HP, gain 50 AP. Your berry trees turn golden.
- Nerf GRASS 7: 30 → 25 HP healed every 2 seconds

> The goal is to give GRASS synergy a true vertical as we did with other synergies, while not making it overpowered. The performance of Grass last patch seemed to be related to FLORA so we hope other nerfs will keep it in check.

- Buff FIELD: healing on field unit KO increased: 30/35/40 → 30/40/50
- Buff FOSSIL: Fossil effects are now triggered at 30% HP instead of 0% HP.

- MIRACLE_SEED, LEAF_STONE and STICKY_BARB now gives 15 max HP instead of 15 SHIELD.

- New recipe for GREEN_ORB: MIRACLE_SEED + MYSTIC_WATER. Base stats: 3 SPE_DEF → 15 HP
- New recipe for STAR_DUST: NEVER_MELT_ICE + MYSTIC_WATER. Base stats: 50 SHIELD → 10 SPE_DEF.

> It took a while, but we finally have a HP-based item component. Green Orb and Star Dust recipe switch should help for players coming from TFT. Oh, and King's Rock makes you truely the King of the board now.

## New items

- Added GOLDEN_PINAP_BERRY, GOLDEN_NANAB_BERRY and GOLDEN_RAZZ_BERRY
- New dishes: MUSHROOMS: TINY_MUSHROOM, BIG_MUSHROOM, BALM_MUSHROOM

- All craftable synergy stones base stats have been doubled.

## Item reworks

- RICH_MULCH and AMAZE_MULCH can now be used on berry trees to instantly fully grow them

> Funny interaction between mulch and berry trees, mostly useful if you're stuck on a low FLORA for a while.

- HEAT_STONE changed: no longer has additional chance to burn with their attacks. Instead, your Pokémon gain 3 ATK.

- Nerf SPELL_TAG: CURSE duration increased: 9 → 10 seconds
- Buff SHINY_STONE: now also gives 50 AP

# Changes to carousels & PvE rounds

> Stage 1 starter pick brought the unintended side-effect of having one more component in the early game, and one you choose. This led to slamming strong items earlier than before, and a more agressive early game overall. We're reverting stage 15 changes to get back to the previous pacing.

- Stage 15 component pick is back, and stage 2 no longer gives a random component as a reward. Instead, the rewards of stage 2 are the 1 out of 3 component pick proposed on stage 3.
- Item components carousels now have 40% chance to include one additional FOSSIL_STONE. Otherwise they will only propose other item components.
- Removed the reward change between component and full item on stage 19 PvE, based on the amount of components collected. It is too easy to manipulate with Silk Scarf, Unown-I and ground digging. Stage 19 PvE now always offers a full craftable item as a reward.
- New town encounter: Cinccino
- New town encounter: Magnezone
- Rework Xatu town encounter: now gives a TREASURE_BOX for free. It will open when the player goes below 40% HP, granting the same random reward to all players.
- Makuhita can now be encountered at stage 17, and no longer at stage 22
- Wigglypuff mission gold reward is now automatically granted when the mission is completed, instead of requiring to click on Chatot
- Portal symbols generation at stage 20 has been reworked. Symbols pool size is now limited to 7 symbols, and the amount of symbols of the same synergy is limited to the number of players alive.

> This intends to fix two problems we observed with portal symbols generation at stage 20: the inconsistency of Dragon/Amorphous symbols due to the amount of active synergy thresholds, and the overconsistency of vertical synergies when several players play it in the same lobby.

# Changes to Statuses

- LOCKED status now prevents dodging
- CURSE status on cleanse got its delay increased by ~~1~~ 2 seconds
- POISON status now has a different animation when badly poisoned (3 stacks or more)
- FAIRY_FIELD has a new animation

# Changes to Weather

- Fire weather is renamed from ZENITH to DROUGHT
- ZENITH is now the weather triggered by GRASS synergy. New effect: +15% healing, -30% SLEEP duration

# Pokemon Alternative Forms

> We are introducing the notion of Pokémon alternative forms in the game. Alternative Forms are mostly aesthetic variations of the same Pokémon, that will be merged in your Collection and in various other places. This makes it easier to complete your Collection, your Pokédex, and nail it at Pokéguessr.

List of Pokémon with alternative forms: Flabebe, Floette, Florges, Minior, Silvally, Arceus, Alcremie, Ogerpon, Basculin, Basculegion, Darmanitan, Maushold, Hoopa, Aegislash, Vivillon, Mimikyu, Deoxys, Lycanroc

- Collection shards can now be used to buy any alternative form of a Pokémon.
- All the existing shards you had on an alternative form will be attributed to the base form.
- Pokéguesser now accepts any alternative form of the Pokémon to guess as a correct answer.
- Titles Collector and Duke accept any alternative form of the Pokémon to count towards their total.
- Silvally now has 18 alternative forms based on its first synergy item given at evolution.
- Arceus now has 18 alternative forms based on its first synergy given.
- Change to the boosters: alternative forms are now picked after picking the Pokémon, rather than adding all variants to the pool first. This reduces the frequency of Pokémon with multiple alternative forms (such as Flabebe or Vivillon) appearing in boosters.

# User Interface

> Meta report got a big upgrade this patch, with new sections and charts to help you figure out the best team compositions and items.

- Added new meta report sections: Compositions, Cluster map, Region tracking
- Added a chart for Pokémon meta report and item meta report, showing count vs average placement
- Current game mode is now displayed in the game top bar
- Added a tooltip on the experience bar to show gold needed to level up and number of clicks required
- Improve the filters on Wiki Pokémon and synergies pages. Can now filter alternative forms.

# Bugfix

> We found too late that Loaded Dice second hit damage was incorrectly calculated, and it had a significant impact on the meta. Oopsie. Several resurrection related bugs, that many players thought were not bugs, have also been fixed. So no more secret strats around Max Revive, a unit resurrecting should get back to the state it was when the fight started.

- Fix LOADED_DICE second hit damage dealing 100% instead of 75% of the attack damage
- Field SPEED stacks are now correctly reset after resurrection
- Units now properly reset their targeting after their target starts resurrecting
- Resurrection now properly reset all temporary stat buffs, including buffs from abilities
- Resurrecting now also properly reset positive statuses: protect, rune protect, enrage, spike armor, magic bounce, reflect and Pokérus
- Fossil starter portals now always offer an Eevee.
- Fix the display of buried items when equipped with EXPLORER_KIT.
- Fixed arrow key keybinds not working when bound via the options (Previous player's board, Next player's board)
- Berry trees can no longer share the same berry type.

> Props to tegberen for spotting the next two issues and telling us. They explain why Fairy and Rock were performing so differently against Dark.

- Additional bonus damage on FAIRY shocks provided by FAIRY synergy effects now applies to the shock damage, and not the incoming damage.
- Crit damage reduction from ROCK synergy effects now applies to the final crit damage after crit power is applied, instead of before.

- Added Region tracking to statistic
- Wandering Unown now have 5% chance to be shiny, giving 250 shards on capture instead of 50. Unown encounter chance: 3.7% → 3.3%
- New title: Poffin Master - Cook a Poffin with 3 different golden berries in it
- New title: Top Gun - Get to Mach 10 with a Mach Ribbon
- New title: Scout - Equip your team with at least 5 Silk Scarf made items
- Added a new meta report section, with a cluster map and a dendrogram
- Added a chart for pokemon report and item report, count function of average place
- Change to the boosters: alternative forms are now picked after picking the Pokémon, rather than adding all variants to the pool first. This reduces the frequency of Pokémon with multiple alternative forms (such as Flabebe or Vivillon) appearing in boosters.
- New town encounter: Magnezone
- Fix lazy loading of Pokémon sprites when entering a game for the second time without cache unloaded.

> Sorry for making you refresh your page on every other game to get the Pokémon out of their pokéballs. The main cause should be fixed now, but other causes may still exist.

# Misc

- Added a very small chance to get a "god pack" booster
- Wandering Unown now have 5% chance to be shiny, giving 250 shards on capture instead of 50. Unown encounter chance: 3.7% → 3.3%
- New title: Poffin Master - Cook a POFFIN with 3 different golden berries in it
- New title: Top Gun - Get to Mach 10 with a MACH_RIBBON
- New title: Scout - Equip your team with at least 5 SILK_SCARF made items
