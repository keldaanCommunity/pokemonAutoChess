# Changes to Synergies

# Changes to Items

# Gameplay

# UI

- Pokemons sprites are now lazy-loaded. This should reduce game loading times and memory usage significantly, at the cost of having a small delay before the Pokémon sprites are displayed for the first time. A wobbling pokéball is shown while the sprite is being loaded (shouldn't take more than 1 second in most cases).

# Bugfix

- Added missing Field Memory Disc for Silvally
- All dash abilities and abilities hitting in between two cells now guarantee to hit at least the original target if no other enemies are hit. Abilities impacted: Aqua Jet, Flame Charge, Volt Switch, Wheel of Fire, Infernal Parade, Dig, Poison Powder, Silver Wind, Pyro Ball, Whirlpool, Magical Leaf, Snipe Shot, Extreme Speed, Psystrike, Psyshield Bash, Power Whip, Pastel Veil, Steel Wing, Firestarter, Surf, Steam Roller
- Fixed Comet shard description and removed AP scaling that was applied by mistake.
