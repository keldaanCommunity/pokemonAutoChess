A wobbling pokéball is shown while the sprite is being loaded (should not take more than 1 second in most cases).
- Round distance (number of rounds since your last fight with a player) is now shown in the player detail tooltip when hovering over a player's icon in game. This is useful to have a better guess of who will be your next opponent, since matchmaking is designed to maximize the round distance for all players.
