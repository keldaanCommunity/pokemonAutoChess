# Gameplay

- Max fight duration has been increased from 40 seconds to 45 seconds. You should get less draws now.

- Units with both Burn and Freeze status now unfreeze twice faster

- Board effects (Smog, traps, terrain...) can now overlap on the same cell. Units moving into a cell with multiple board effects will gain all effects.

# UI

- Pokemons sprites are now lazy-loaded. This should reduce game loading times and memory usage significantly, at the cost of having a small delay before the Pokémon sprites are displayed for the first time. A wobbling pokéball is shown while the sprite is being loaded (should not take more than 1 second in most cases).
- Synergies count and battle stats now can be moved around the screen and minimized/maximized as needed.
- Round distance (number of rounds since your last fight with a player) is now shown in the player detail tooltip when hovering over a player's icon in game. This is useful to have a better guess of who will be your next opponent, since matchmaking is designed to maximize the round distance for all players.
- Wiki items section has been reworked for better readability.
- New section on the wiki: Stages
- New icons for TM and HM items
- Added colorblind mode option in preferences. When enabled, Pokémon shadows are displayed in red for enemies, making it easier to spot them on the board. We're looking for feedback from colorblind players to improve it further, please reach out on our Discord if you have suggestions!
