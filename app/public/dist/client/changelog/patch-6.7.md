# UI

- Pokemons sprites are now lazy-loaded. This should reduce game loading times and memory usage significantly, at the cost of having a small delay before the Pokémon sprites are displayed for the first time. A wobbling pokéball is shown while the sprite is being loaded (should not take more than 1 second in most cases).
- Round distance (number of rounds since your last fight with a player) is now shown in the player detail tooltip when hovering over a player's icon in game. This is useful to have a better guess of who will be your next opponent, since matchmaking is designed to maximize the round distance for all players.
