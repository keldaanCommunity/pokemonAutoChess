# Changes to Pokemon & Abilities

- Changed Taunt: Now all enemies within attack range (the attack range of the enemy, to be clear) are forced to target the user, instead of all enemies within a 2-tile radius.
- Deino can now be found in Dark regions
- Impidimp can now only be found in Human regions
