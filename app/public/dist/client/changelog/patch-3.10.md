## A big wave of synergy reworks for the summer

Dragon, Water, Psychic, Rock, Monster and Artifical synergies have been reworked with new exclusive mechanics !

## Familiar faces

Fish for Magikarp, or get Unowns in the shop. They may look weak at first, but they have some surprises in store. We also welcome Pinsir, Natu and Xatu !
