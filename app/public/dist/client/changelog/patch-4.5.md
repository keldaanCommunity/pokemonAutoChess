# Introducing Ranked Matches

Ranked matches are lobbies created automatically by the server at a certain time, that require a minimum rank to participate.
We hope ranked matches will allow the most regular players in the community to meet and get into more competitive lobbies, while also letting beginners spectate high ELO matches.

To begin with, Great Ball tier (ELO > 1100) ranked matches will start every 4 hours. The winner gets an extra booster and a new title. We will collect your feedback to adjust the timing, minimum rank and rewards of these matches on future updates.
