# Gameplay changes

- POSSESSED is no longer considered a negative status if by being possessed it came to your team
- SNOW weather: -10 speed if not ICE instead of -20
- Crowd control (CC) statuses that prevent attacking and movement (Sleep, Freeze, Lock) now have a 1-second cooldown per unit when they wear off or are cleansed, preventing them from being immediately re-applied. This is intended to give units a small window to act and mitigate infinite CC locking combos.

# Bugfix

- Fix Twist Band not reversing ghost curses stat debuffs
- Fix Pikachu Surfer spawn spot when on red team

# Misc

- Ghost opponents avatars are now displayed in semi-transparent
