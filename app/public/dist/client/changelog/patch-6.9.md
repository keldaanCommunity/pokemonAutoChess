# Changes to Synergies

> HM were too restrictive in design and not impactful enough, therefore we're replacing them with more powerful and exciting TM. Splitting TM into 3 categories allows us to have more control over the power gap between each level of HUMAN synergy. No more Pay Day Braixen slam on stage 2 !

- HUMAN HM have been removed, and TM are now split into 3 categories: Bronze, Silver and Gold ; each category matching one synergy level of Human synergy. Removed TM Taunt. New TMs: Charge, Focus Punch, Hyper Beam, Protect, Skill Swap
- TMs are now unlearned and regained dynamically based on HUMAN synergy level
- Nerf HUMAN healing: 25/40/60% → 25/35/50%

> It will be easier to get a WILD start, but harder to find all your remaining evos in the late game. We also remove the previous quirks of WILD synergy design like the incentive to roll on PvE stages only, or the fact that benched WILD Pokémon contributed to the shop odds, in order to make it more consistent and easier to understand. The new odds allows us to buff Teddiursa line and make it closer to what you could expect from an Ultra category Pokémon.

- Benched WILD Pokémon no longer contribute to WILD shop odds.
- WILD Pokémon have ~~5~~ 8% base chance to be found in shops during PvE encounter stages. If WILD is active, WILD Pokémon can now be found at all stages. For each WILD STAR on board, gain +0.5% chance to find WILD in shops.
- WILD 2: +30 → +20 SPEED. 
- WILD 4: +50 → +40 SPEED.
- WILD 6: +50 SPEED and +20% base ATK → +40 SPEED and +40% base ATK
- New effect for WILD 9: Once below 30% HP, gain 30 Shield and double the Attack and Speed buffs for 3 seconds.

- Fighting 8 now only throw away melee enemies (1 range)

# Changes to Pokémon & Abilities

- New ability for Salandit line: Fire lash ; PP 60 → 100

> Goomy is known as the weakest of all Dragon, yet it was the perfect Epic synergy filler. By moving it to Common, our goal is to encourage players to consider a DRAGON or AMORPHOUS angle earlier in the game (especially for beginners who are not used to pivot), while giving lower stats and opening up new alternatives for the end-game boards of these compositions.

- Goomy line is now Common instead of Epic. Adjusted stats.
- Dratini line is now Epic instead of Rare. Adjusted stats. New ability: Twister
- Tynamo line is back to Uncommon instead of Common. Adjusted stats.
- Rework Fury Swipes (Teddiursa): from "Deal a [LK] random number of basic attacks between [2,SP] to [5,SP] times." to "Unleash [5,SP] rapid attacks in one second, each dealing 100% of ATK as PHYSICAL. If the target is KO'd during the ability, regain 20 PP per remaining hit."
- Magnet Pull (Meltan) can no longer be casted by Metronome. Rarity of attracted mon now follows your current player level rarity odds.
- Buff Glaive Rush (Frigibax): enemies hit now also get ARMOR_BREAK for 6 seconds
- New passive for Fletchlinder line: drops embers on the ground when flying away.

# Changes to Items

- Buff Nutritious Egg: ~~30%~~ → 50% bonus ATK, DEF and SPE_DEF
- Added visual effects for support items on adjacent positions

# Changes to Gameplay

- Crowd control (CC) statuses that prevent attacking and movement (Sleep, Freeze, Lock) now have a 1-second cooldown per unit when they wear off or are cleansed, preventing them from being immediately re-applied. This is intended to give units a small window to act and mitigate infinite CC locking combos.
