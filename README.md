## Objective of this fork
i'm trying to make an installer of the game as an exe file, after that intellingent CPU players against the player and some sort of tournament mode
## Getting started

Install [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en). (It's recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node with the proper version)

Install project dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Download the music files and pack all the game assets:
```
npm run download-music
npm run assetpack
```

Game files are ready, now you need to configure two things: the database (MongoDB), and the authentication provider (Firebase).

Pokemon Auto Chess use mongoDB to store its data and Firebase for authentication. Those 2 dependencies requires credentials to use. Credentials will be stored in a `.env` file in the root folder of the repository. If you do not have a `.env` file in your root repository, make one now and open it in notepad.

### MongoDB

You can either setup the mongo database using the cloud based [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) or using the [local installation](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

In both cases, create a database named `dev` with an empty collection named `botv2`. Then retrieve the URI connection. 

If you are using MongoDB Cloud, you may need to create an admin user under Database Access > Create a New User. Make sure to Add Built-in Role > Atlas admin.

- A cloud uri will look like smth `mongodb+srv://admin:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/dev?retryWrites=true&w=majority`.
- The local uri will look smth like `mongodb://localhost:27017/dev`.

In order to play against bots, you will need to load bots data into your newly created database. In MongoDB Compass, import bots data (`./db-commmands/botv2.json`) in the `botV2` empty collection.

In the `.env` file at the root folder, add the mongoDB URI:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dev
```

### Firebase

Pokemon Auto Chess uses the Firebase authentication module to let players create accounts and login to the game.

First create an account and a firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

Inside the firebase project, create a web app called for example `pokemon-auto-chess-test`.

Add your newly created firebase config in `.env`. All those credentials should be available in the "Configure SDK" section.

```
FIREBASE_API_KEY=<firebase_api_key>
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<firebase_auth_domain>
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<firebase_project_id>
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<firebase_storage_bucket>
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<firebase_messaging_sender_id>
FIREBASE_APP_ID=<firebase_app_id>
```

Then setup the authentication module. In sign in methods, only choose mail/password and anonymous. 

You need to generate a SDK Admin Firebase private key for the server to be able to connect as administrator of the firebase project.

This option is available in Project settings > Service accounts

The private key is a json that contain those informations:

```json
{
  "type": "<type>",
  "project_id": "<project_id>",
  "private_key_id": "<private_key_id>",
  "private_key": "<private_key>",
  "client_email": "<client_email>",
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "auth_uri": "<auth_uri>",
  "token_uri": "<token_uri>",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "<client_x509_cert_url>",
  "universe_domain": "<universe_domain>"
}
```

Add those informations to the `.env`

```
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=<client_email>
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=<private_key>
```

And you are done for the configuration part. Now you should be able to run the game locally ! 

### Run the game

Make sure you did all the previous steps correctly.

To start the development server on your machine:

```
npm run dev
```

Game should run locally on port [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

Development server is useful to quickly test your configuration and work on modifications to the game code. But it's not fully optimized for production.

To make the project production ready, first build the project with:

```
npm run build
```

This task is typically done in Continuous Integration tools.

Then deploy the built files and run the project on your production machine with this command:
```
npm run start
```

### Administration rights

You might want to have full access rights on your local version. To do so, you can set your role to `ADMIN` by editing your player rights in the `usermetadatas` table.

# Development

- Assets are automatically packed from `public/src/assets` to `public/dist/client/assets` with assetpack: `npm run assetpack` ; You will need to run assetpack everytime you change the assets
- The game use precomputed data stored in `app/models/precomputed` folder ; You will need to run `npm run precompute` everytime you change pokemon or synergy data
- We recommend VSCode and these extensions: Biome for formatting and linting and Inlang for translations management.

## How to deploy your own Pokemon Auto Chess

See this [README](https://github.com/keldaanCommunity/pokemonAutoChess/blob/master/deployment/README.md)

## Internationalisation

- In VSCode, use the inlang (i18n) extension
- Bind the Inlang: Extract Message on a keyboard touch, for example (²)
- Select the string you want to translate. Press ², a prompt will ask the id you want for this string. It'll add the corresponding entry in the english translation file.
- Once you are finished, you can run npm run translate to machine translate the missing translations

Please note that we only support the english language. Other languages are managed by the community.
